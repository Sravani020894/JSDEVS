//Create an array of movies with at least three movies.
let arr=["jawan","jailer","japan"];
//Using the array from above, store the first movie in a variable
let srk = arr[0];
//Get the length of the original array and store it in a new variable
let len = arr.length;
//Get the last element in that array and store it in a new variable. What if your array was really large and you didn't know the last index? Would your solution still work?
let last = arr[len-1];
